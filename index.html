                    <p><span style="color:#25c5df; font-size:18px;"><b>ABOUT ROOTS</b></span> <br><br>Youth Mental Health Alliance is a student run organization that aims to enhance support, knowledge and access to mental health services for students in Montreal. As students we believe that the best way to promote mental health and eliminate the stigma that is associated with it is through education and understanding of the issues that mental health encompasses. Because of this, we’ve created Roots on the basis of three pillars – education, support and communication. <br><br>We aim to achieve this through outreach programs that are meant to educate students both on University campuses and in Montreal. Our outreach programs are specifically targeted towards the segment of the population with the most potential, and with the greatest ability to drive change: the youth. By educating the youth, we are able to eliminate the stigma surrounding mental health from the ground up, so that young people may help their parents and their elders to understand the true gravity of mental illness. By focusing on the youth, we are able to provide a forum to discuss topics which many youth might otherwise be afraid to bring up. <br><br>We hope that our initiative will inspire youth who might be dealing with mental illness to have the confidence and the initiative to make a change as well. 
</p>
                    <p><span style="color:#25c5df; font-size:18px;"><b>ABOUT MENTAL HEALTH</b></span> <br><br> Mental health is not merely the absence of mental disorder but is an overall feeling of emotional, psychological and social well-being. In this state of well-being an individual:
 	<br><ul>
 	<li>Realizes their own potential</li>
  	<li>Can cope with the normal stresses of life</li>
  	<li>Can work productively and fruitfully</li>
  	<li>Is able to make a contribution to his or her community</li>
    </ul><br>
(World Health Organization)<br><br>
 
Mental illness on the other hand is characterized by alterations in thinking, mood or behaviour – or some combination thereof – associated with significant distress and impaired functioning. This often leads to diagnosis of a clinical condition (based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5)).
 
<br><br>A common misconception is that mental health or well-being and mental illness are opposing ends of a spectrum. Each of these constructs is on it’s own spectrum from low to high. As an example to illustrate this, one may have high mental illness (diagnosed condition) but also high mental health as they may be able to engage in activities such as volunteering or work and may have a good network of support from family and friends. As such, we cannot assume that if an individual has a diagnosed condition, they have poor mental health, and equally so we cannot assume that just because someone does not have a diagnosed or clinical condition that they have high mental health.

Rather than trivializing mental health, the workshops aim to promote understanding and awareness how mental health applies to everyone. It will provide an ongoing and interactive discussion on stigma, determinants of mental health, and issues of mental health that effect youth. <br /><br /> We aim to have around 12-15 participants in each workshop, and they will cover the following topics: <br /><br /> Dates & Topics: <br />March 12th, 2016\: Introduction to mental health, communication and the importance of stigma reduction. <br  />March 19th, 2016\: School and family related anxiety and stress. <br  /><br  /> (Note that workshops are not intended to mimic or replace any form of psychological treatment, but rather to inform youth about topics related to mental health and also to promote discussion amongst these youth)',width:850,height:400,opacity:20,topsplit:3, top: 30px;})" class="col-md-3" style="padding-top:20px; width: 32%">

                        One of our missions is to inform youth about mental well-being and local services, and in particular, we’re trying to reach out to neighbourhoods in Montreal that are of a lower socioeconomic status. To help us reach our goal, we are proud to work with the Milton Park Recreation Association (MPRA). In particular, we value and support MPRA’s mission which is “to bridge differences and bring people closer together by offering a wide variety of affordable courses and programs which contribute to individual growth and learning, and by building partnerships with individuals and organizations in the community to help achieve these objectives.”
<br><br>MRPA has kindly offered us a venue at Galeries du Parc for all of our future workshops. We’re so glad to be able to work with this association to make mental health services more accessible to youth and increase awareness of local programs and services.

                        <b>Youth Outreach Program (YOP)<br></b>
                        McGill's Youth Outreach Program (YOP) is an organization through which McGill students can act as mentors for youth in group homes and juvenile detention centers in Montreal. The aims of the program are to:<br><br>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Create safe opportunities for self-expression and the development of interpersonal skills of the youth, while promoting the learning of soft literacy skills</li>
                            <li>Provide social support to the youth by being a mentor</li>
                            <li>Focus on the positive qualities and gifts of the youth</li>
                            <li>Create a safe and accepting environment for the youth</li>
                            <li>Plan activities that are relevant to the needs of the youth by working with the youth and not for them or on them</li>
                        </ul><br>
In order to reach these goals, mentors visit the youth once a week for approximately 1 hour in groups of 4-5 volunteers. The main focus of the program is to help youth develop soft literacy skills through games and activities – these can be anything from Pictionary to reading a recipe for baking cookies. Through this, mentors are also able to develop positive skills in the youth, such as communication. It is an extremely rewarding program for both the youth and the volunteers involved!</p>

Founded in 2015, our program is based on studies that have shown the benefits derived from expressing one\'s self to a compassionate listener. We do not offer counselling, psychotherapy or advice. We provide you with a listening ear and a safe space to vent. Our volunteers are trained in active listening and will help you work through your problems by asking reflective questions and and showing empathetic regard. Sometimes we feel trapped in our situations and don\'t feel as if there is anyone in our life to whom we can speak with. That\'s where we come in. We are the friend you haven\'t met before\; a fresh pair of ears to your story.<br  /><br  />For more info: http://ventovertea.wix.com/vent',width:700,height:300,opacity:20,topsplit:3})" class="col-md-3" style="padding:0.5px; width: 33.3%">
